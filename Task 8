Verify IP Address:

Go to https://whatismyipaddress.com

Note your new IP address and location.

Test Encryption and Traffic:

Visit HTTPS websites (like Gmail, Reddit, etc.) and check if they load securely.

Confirm the green padlock icon in browser address bar = encrypted.

Disconnect from the server and compare the new IP address (again via whatismyipaddress.com).

And also noted any change in browsing speed.








Interview Questions – Answers
1. What is a VPN?

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure and encrypted connection between your device and the internet, masking your IP address and encrypting your data.

2. How does a VPN protect privacy?

It encrypts all data traffic, making it unreadable to ISPs, hackers, or surveillance. It also hides your IP address, preventing location and identity tracking.

3. Difference between VPN and Proxy?
Feature	VPN	Proxy
Encryption	Yes	No
Speed	Slightly slower	Faster
Anonymity	Higher	Lower
Traffic Type	Whole device/app traffic	Only browser/app configured
Security Level	High	Low
4. What is encryption in VPN?

Encryption is the process of encoding data so only authorized parties can read it. VPNs use encryption (like AES-256) to protect data in transit from being intercepted.

5. Can VPN guarantee complete anonymity?

No, VPNs improve privacy but do not guarantee full anonymity. VPN providers can still log activity unless they follow a strict no-logs policy. Also, websites can still track you via cookies or browser fingerprinting.

6. What protocols do VPNs use?

Common protocols include:

OpenVPN – Secure and open-source

IKEv2/IPSec – Fast and mobile-friendly

WireGuard – Lightweight and very fast

L2TP/IPSec – Older and less secure

PPTP – Deprecated, insecure

7. What are some VPN limitations?

Speed reduction

Doesn’t prevent malware or phishing

Not 100% anonymous

VPN servers may be blocked by websites

May not work in countries with heavy censorship (e.g., China)

8. How does a VPN affect network speed?

It may reduce your speed due to:

Encryption overhead

Distance to the VPN server

Server load (especially on free plans)
Still, modern VPNs like WireGuard minimize this impact.
